# Project Title (This is a template README.md file that you can adapt to your project)
Inequality in Education-Analyzing How Socioeconomic Conditions Affect Student Achievement

> A brief description of what the project does and its purpose.
This project addresses inequality of educational opportunity in U.S. high schools. Here we will focus on average student performance on the ACT or SAT exams that students take as part of the college application process.
Do smaller schools with lower student–teacher ratios perform better on the ACT, even after controlling for socioeconomic factors such as household income and unemployment rates?
